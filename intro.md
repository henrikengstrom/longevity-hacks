# longevity-hacks

This repository contains random notes about longevity hacks. This topic is something I have been interested in for a long period of time and over the last couple of years I have found really good sources of information for what one should do to achieve longevity. The goal is to make this information easy to digest and adopt while also being completley free.

## why a repo?

The idea behind this repo is two-fold;
1. A place where I can keep track of the latest and greatest for my own book keeping
2. A place where I can point family, friends, and fellow human beings who are interested in learning more

## references

Some of the references will point to sources that are behind some sort of paywall. It is up to the reader if she would like to pay for more detailed information of certain topics. The aim of this repo is to provide a good enough overview for the reader for free.

## who am I?

A software engineer who has always been interested in health, nutrition, and exercise. I am by no means an expert and **not** a medical doctor so any advice in here should be run by your personal MD before you try it. At least if you live in the US. For other countries where lawsuites are less common you can just use your own good judgement :)

# foundations

Longevity is a extremely large and complicated topic and there are a plethora of ideas, thoughts, and borderline religions for what one should do to unlock a long and heathy life.

## what I mean by longevity - a.k.a. defintion

Longevity is sometimes used as a synonym for "life expectansy" and while there is nothing wrong with that definition it misses a key point, namely health. In this repo we are expanding a little on the common meaning of the word to mean: a long **and** healthy life.

## our main goal: postpone chronic deceases

The longer one can postpone common chronic deceases the better one has planted the seed for longevity. In the western world chronic deceases are on a steady rise and we must do our utmost to postpone any onset of such illnesses. This document contains a set of basic ideas that most researchers within this domain can agree on.

## core tenants for longevity: sleep, exercise, and nutrition

The three pillars of longevity are not very surprising:
* [sleep](sleep/sleep.md)
* [exercise](exercise/exercise.md)
* [nutrition](nutrition/nutrition.md)

These pillars used to be envisioned to stand next to each other to form the foundation of longevity however more and more points to that the latter two are resting on the former, i.e. sleep alone stands for about 50% - the rock foundation upon the other two pillars stand.
